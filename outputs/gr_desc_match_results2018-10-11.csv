technolog,360G-ocf-a061600000lwFHz,Soundworks,"We recently fostered a link with a local recording studio (Soundworks in Blackbird Leys) that has offered opportunities to two people we work with to visit the studio for four weeks each to experience difference areas of the recording process. This had a profound effect on the people involved, and following this, we had lots of other people express interest and excitement. Unfortunately, the recording studio cannot sustain an ongoing project for free and we would like to create an ongoing programme that will enable more people to benefit from this unique opportunity. We are applying to the Midcounties Co-operative Community fund for funding to cover costs to enable an individual to have four weekly sessions of two hours each int he recording studio. In their studio time, they can choose what area they would like to learn about - be it production, mixing ore recording etc. We also have music tutors who would be willing to offer music lessons for very reduced prices. People could therefore also choose to have an hour music tuition int he studio space, with instruments provided, which they could then use towards their wider work in the studio. This programme would run for one year, enabling twelve people to participate with a structure of two sessions with an engineer and two with practice time and an hour of music lessons (if wanted or simply four with an engineer. This project has the scope to positively affect the people we work with ina variety of ways. It offers them the chance to be part of a creative process, and to access the arts in a less traditional more exciting way. It is also a very flexible opportunity, which allows them to choose exactly what areas they want to learn about, from writing songs to dj-ing to learning about production technology. It can be a way for people to start thinking about education as more expansive than just classrooms (which does not suit so many people). It also offers people the chance to take on responsibility for an activity, in which they must focus on timekeeping and behaviour. Fundamentally, this is something that will take place outside of the homeless pathway. Travelling somewhere that is not part of 'service rout', and in which they meet members of the wider community, is often an underestimated experience. We find that participating in activities with the general public is something that the people we work with find valuable, and is instrumental in changing their perceptions of themselves as 'outsiders' We hope that, with time, to see this project lead to the formation of a band that will also encourage people to see the therapeutic benefits of music and working as a team.",1920.0,2016-11-14,2016-12-01,Mayday Trust,1035524,GB-CHC-1151621,Oxfordshire Community Foundation
